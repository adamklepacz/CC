Because I do not use ECMAScript 2016 yet, You can find 2 files for task 2. <br>
CCFrontTask2.js  is written just as a basic "function damage() { return damagePoints } <br>
CCFrontTask2v2.js is a file with exports.damage = damage;  <br>

If v2 version doesn't work properly I'm sorry  - I've never used before "import" "export" tools.

<b>But check CCFrontTask2.js which is a basic function, it works properly, and damage function returns <br>
correct results in reference to examples which I recieved from You. </b>

I await impatiently for Your feedback. <br>
<b>This internship would be a great possibility for me to learn and work in CLEARCODE.</b><br>
